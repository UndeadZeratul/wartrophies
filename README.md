### Installation
---
Download the zip and load it into GZDoom. No need to change its extension to .pk3. However, a .pk3 extension is required when loading the mod with Delta Touch.

### Important
---
- The mod is not multiplayer compatible!
- You currently need a dev build of GZDoom to run this! It uses bleeding edge features. Get a dev build [here](https://devbuilds.drdteam.org/gzdoom/).
- Loading a previous a save game will revert progress to what it was at the time of saving! This is, unfortunately, unavoidable. Data is saved in server CVars as user CVars have a length limit. A feature suggestion has been opened on the forum to allow excluding server CVars from being saved. Until it gets implemented, if at all, keep this note in mind.

### Do this if you want addon support
---
- Add a Tag property to your weapons/monsters.  
*The mod will work without it, but raw class names will be displayed instead and it won't look good unless your class names are sensible.*
