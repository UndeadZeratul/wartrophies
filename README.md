### Installation
---
Download the zip and load it into GZDoom. No need to change its extension to .pk3. However, a .pk3 extension is required when loading the mod with Delta Touch.

### Important
---
- The mod is not multiplayer compatible!
- Requires GZDoom 4.3.2!
***DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LOAD THIS WITH GZDOOM 4.3.1! YOU WILL LOSE ALL PROGRESS ON EXIT! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! This is because the "nosave" CVARINFO keyword does not do what it's supposed to do in that version!***

### Do this if you want addon support
---
- Add a Tag property to your weapons/monsters.  
*The mod will work without it, but raw class names will be displayed instead and it won't look good unless your class names are sensible.*
