### Installation
---
Download the zip and load it into GZDoom. No need to change its extension to .pk3. However, a .pk3 extension is required when loading the mod with Delta Touch.

### Important
---
- Requires at least GZDoom 4.3.3 (when it's out)! Playing it on anything lower that that won't work right and you may lose progress. You have been warned.
- The mod may not be multiplayer compatible! Not tested.
- Due to the way data is saved, mod may cause ini bloat if played with too many mods for a long time. The data is at the bottom of your config file in a separate section. If ini bloat really bothers you, this mod probably isn't for you. At the moment there is no other way to store data globally.

### Do this if you want addon support
---
- Add a Tag property to your weapons/monsters.  
*The mod will work without it, but raw class names will be displayed instead and it won't look good unless your class names are sensible.*
