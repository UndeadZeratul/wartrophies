### Installation
---
Download the zip and load it into GZDoom. No need to change its extension to .pk3. However, a .pk3 extension is required when loading the mod with Delta Touch.

### Important
---
- The mod is not multiplayer compatible!
- Requires at least GZDoom 4.3.0!
- Loading a previous save game will revert kill stats to what they were at the time of saving! A feature to help fix this was requested and implemented engine-side, but it is currently only available in a GZDoom dev build. If you're reading this, the issue has not been fixed.

### Do this if you want addon support
---
- Add a Tag property to your weapons/monsters.  
*The mod will work without it, but raw class names will be displayed instead and it won't look good unless your class names are sensible.*
